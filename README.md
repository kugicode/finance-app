## Finance-App

This is my final year project my thesis! This project involves a smart dashboard to track money that users input and uses gemini API to give users advice for their spendings!

## The Tech stack
React (Next.js), Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.

## The features I've built so far
I Added Add/Delete logic, income vs Expense tracking, and live balance calculations.

## Upcoming features
MongoDB integration - So data stays in the database.
AI finance Coaching - So the AI can give users advice.
Recharts.js - So users can see the graphs and line charts of their spending like in revolut apps.
Responsiveness - Using tailwindcss so my app works on both PC and mobile.
